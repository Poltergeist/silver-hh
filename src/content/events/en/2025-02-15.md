### Charity

**All entry fees will be donated to Hinz&Kunzt** - Hamburg's street magazine for homeless and poor people.

Hinz&Kunzt is a non-profit project that enables over 530 homeless and poor people in Hamburg to earn their own income by selling the street magazine. The vendors buy the magazines for €1.10 and sell them for €2.50 - the profit goes directly to them. The project not only provides financial support, but also social integration and meaningful work.
