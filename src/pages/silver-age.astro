    <h1>What is Silver Age?</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Silver Age</strong> is an accessible, fast-paced Flesh and Blood format designed for quick, intense matches.
      It features young heroes, lower life totals, and strategic deck selection from a limited card pool, making it
      perfect for competitive play with a lower barrier to entry.

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <div style="margin-top:12px;">
      <h3 style="margin-bottom:8px;">Young Heroes Only</h3>
      <p>
        Play with young hero cards (common, rare, or basic rarity). The lower life totals create faster,
        more aggressive games that focus on efficient plays and quick decision-making.
      </p>

      <h3 style="margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;">Strategic Card Selection</h3>
      <p>
        Build a 55-card pool including your hero, weapons, equipment, and deck cards. At the start of each game,
        you select exactly 40 cards from this pool to use in that match, allowing you to adapt your strategy.
      </p>

      <h3 style="margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;">Accessible Card Rarities</h3>
      <p>
        Only common, rare, and basic rarity cards are legal. This keeps deck costs lower and makes the format
        more accessible while maintaining competitive depth.
